# house-timeline

There are 4 strangers living in the same house: Bill, Elon, Mark, and Tim. This house has 3 shared areas where they can live together: Living Room, Kitchen, and Backyard.

Due to COVID-19 situation they decided to track and keep house areas on the website to make it easier to see how often theyâ€™re facing each other.

The rules of this house are that each area gate will open for in/out only at 00 and 30 each hour, for example 00:00, 00:30, 15:30, etc.
